# react-native-test-app

Based on expo-cli

Can test in android studio or on real device with **Expo go**

**Tips:**
  - View === div; Text === span/p
  - Can't use html tags 
  - This is not CSS => it will be transformed to something else (repeated not all properties, bit added few)
  - Everything will be transformed according to platforms API's (web, android, ios)
  - View has display: flex; by default
